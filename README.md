A collection of projects developed during Hashtag Treinamentos' **AI Agents and n8n Immersion**. Each lesson produces an independent project that is documented and adapted to a distinct scenario.

## Projects

| Lesson | Project | Technologies | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [AI agent for initial email support](projetos/projeto-01-agente-email/) | n8n, Gmail, Google Gemini, Docker | Completed |
| 2 | Coming soon | — | Planned |
| 3 | Coming soon | — | Planned |
| 4 | Coming soon | — | Planned |

## Project 1

The first project monitors Gmail messages, applies a filter condition, and uses a Google Gemini agent to draft initial customer-support responses. The implementation was adapted for web-design inquiries.

Key concepts:

- Gmail, n8n, and Google Gemini integration
- A prompt with clear limits on commercial authority
- Gmail-compatible HTML output
- Conversation context separated by `threadId`
- Protections against malicious instructions embedded in email content
- Workflow sanitization before publication
